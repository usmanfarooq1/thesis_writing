    \textbf{\large DECLARATION}
\end{center}


I declare that have produced the Master’s thesis \textbf{\thesisTitle} independently and without improper external assistance and that I have identified all
word-for-word quotations of other authors, as well as comments based closely on other authors’ ideas, and I have listed the relevant sources.


I am aware that, unless agreed otherwise, the Master’s thesis  produced under supervision represents a group achievement and forms part of the overall
research of the supervising institution. As a result, none of the co-authors (e.g. authors of text, creative project staff, co-supervisors) may use passages
from the thesis for commercial purposes or make them accessible to third parties without the (written) approval of all those involved due to reasons of copyright.
Particular note must be taken of the Arbeitnehmererfindergesetz (German Employee Invention Act), according to which pre-publication of patent-related content is prohibited.
