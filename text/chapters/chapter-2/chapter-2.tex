\chapter{Background Information}
\label{chap:background_information}
The realm of geospatial data analysis is a complex field that has long struggled with the task of comprehending the intricate shape and surface of the Earth.
This challenge has led to the development of various models and methodologies over centuries. The driving force behind these efforts is the practical need for navigation,
accurate distance measurement, and the precise positioning of data for analysis. This chapter delves into the evolution and significance of the geographical Earth model,
highlighting the intricate nature of representing the Earth's shape through models such as the Geoid and Ellipsoid models. Additionally, it explores the importance of
map projections in converting the Earth's three-dimensional reality into two-dimensional representations, which are essential for the application of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in analyzing geospatial phenomena.
