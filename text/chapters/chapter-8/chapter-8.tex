\chapter{Experiments \& Results}

The experimentation is conducted on four different types of map projections, namely Cylindrical, Pseudocylindrical, Conic and Planar projections. Each of the map projections type contain four different map projections.
The U-Net model mentioned in \autoref{chap:approach} is trained for 20 epochs for each of the map projections. Initially 120 epochs were defined for the experimentation, for each of the models the phenomenon of overfitting started to occur over the training period, to mitigate the issue \textbf{early stopping} was deployed and each model was trained for 20 epochs.
Mean absolute error (MAE) is used as a metric for the evaluation of the model.

16 geospatial raster datasets with the raster resolution of 240x240 were generated for the experimentation, via the process of creating rasters as mentioned in \autoref{chap:preprocess}. The loss and the metrics discussed in the result section are the average results, as for each map projection dataset the U-Net model is trained four times mitigating the issue of randomness in the network's parameters.

The training of the models is displayed for all of the 4 cylindrical projections and 3 of the pseudocylindrical projections, and the values of the metrics used for the evaluation of the model is displayed in a tabular form.
For the conic and the planar projections only the evaluation metrics are shown. In the end we will discuss the overall map projections.
